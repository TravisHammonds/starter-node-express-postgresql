//requires the service object that you created in the previous step and assigns it to categoriesService.

//You can then access the methods on the service object to perform CRUD operations on a table (for example, categoriesService.list()). Chaining then() to categoriesService.list() executes the Knex query. Chaining catch(next) onto the promise will call next(), passing in the error. If the Knex promise doesn't have a catch(next) at the end, it will not correctly handle errors that occur during when running the query.
